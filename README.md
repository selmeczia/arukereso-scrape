# Arukereso.hu scraper
This tool scrapes down the selected item information in the products.csv file from the website 'arukereso.hu' and stores them in an output file where it tracks the:
* Store name
* Price of item
* Minimum price of the run
* Link to the item

There is a built in timer, so it can be set to run every 'x' hours. The tool also contains a file size optimiser which removes duplicate lines only if there were no change in price.
